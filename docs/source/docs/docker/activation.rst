Activation
----------

.. note:: This step requires you to have a registered FlytBase Account. In case you don't have an account, `create a FlytBase Account <http://docs.flytbase.com/docs/FlytOS/GettingStarted/SignUp.html>`_ before you proceed.

You have to activate installed FlytSim, without which critical APIs and Demoapps will not function.

1. Make sure your machine has internet access before proceeding.
2. :ref:`Launch FlytSim <flytsim_launch>` if you have not already done that.
3. `Launch FlytConsole <http://localhost/flytconsole>`_. Make sure Connection Status of FlytConsole is valid. In FlytConsole click on **Activate Now tag** under **License tab** at bottom right corner. A pop-up will appear which will direct you to the device registration page. If you are not logged in, enter your FlytBase Account credentials to log in.
4. Choose a device nick-name and make sure your compute engine is set to FlytSim.
5. In the license drop-down list, select existing license if available or select ‘Issue a new license’. You can also provide a nick-name for your license.
6. Click on Save Changes to register device and generate a license key.
7. Copy the generated license key and enter it in FlytConsole to complete the activation process of your device. The Activate Now tag at bottom right corner of FlytConsole should now turn green.
