Demoapps
--------

Once you have got your FlytSim activated, with `FlytConsole <http://localhost/flytconsole>`_ showing a valid Connection status, you are good to go ahead with trying some of our inbuilt sample apps. 

Open up a shell inside the container by triggering :ref:`openshell <flytsim_shell>` script. Once inside the container, try running `cpp demo app <http://docs.flytbase.com/docs/FlytOS/Developers/BuildingCustomApps/OnboardCPP.html#write-onboard-cpp>`_ or `python demo app <http://docs.flytbase.com/docs/FlytOS/Developers/BuildingCustomApps/OnboardPython.html#write-onboard-python>`_.
